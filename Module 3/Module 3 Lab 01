        <p> <strong>Music</strong>, while it does seem to be a very simple thing to do such as simply sitting down and
            recording it can be quite an experience if you ever plan to make it an actual job rather than a hobby!

        </p> <strong>Did</strong>, you know Michael Jackson's "Invincible" was rougly around 40 million dollars in 2001?
        <br> Adjusting it to 2024 standards it only stood at 71 million dollars which is crazy to think about simply because
        the <br> "Gulfstream II" a private jet from the same year was only sold for 4.9 million.
